# Python-Cat-App

This is a cat application I created with Python using the "Tkinter" import.

This application has 3 key features which are compiled into buttons. The window of the application is not resizable to prevent clipping issues or bugs (generally improves user experience);
thus the application is set to 600x800. To leave the program a user must press 'X' and confirm with the exit prompt. The application's purpose is to display an image of a cat with cat facts
and potentially display a health tip about/related to cats. If the user likes the image of the cat, they can freely download it via the button. All content within the application has been framed
to the centre of the app inside boxes. 

Useable Buttons:

- Generate Fact/Image - Prompts a cat fact and image of a cat to appear inside the respective content boxes
- Cat Health Tip - Prompts a health tip related to cats, will replace cat fact text if present
- Save Image - Allows a user to save the cat image shown, if no cat image is found then an appropriate error will appear
